                   We will collect as much data as is required by our system and
                   that you offer to our system, no more, no less. We will keep
                   the data as secure as possible, but you recognize that
                   unforeseeable incidents may happen that cause data to be lost
                   or stolen. We make every effort to keep our systems as secure
                   as possible.

                <p>
                   Any website collects information about its users. This
                   typically includes data about the device being used (for
                   example, a web browser or a smartphone application), the IP
                   address of the system making requests, HTTP cookies, request
                   timestamps and timezones, and any data (including images)
                   being provided to interact with the various application
                   functions. In addition to the standard HTTP headers and
                   payloads just described, ohmage also collects location
                   information, system analytics regarding smartphone usage,
                   personal data streams, and your email address, if provided.
                   By using the ohmage smartphone application, you acknowledge
                   that this information is being collected about you and your
                   activities. If you are a software developer, the ohmage
                   server APIs are fully documented on
                   <a href="https://github.com/cens/">GitHub </a>.

            <h1 class="light">Why We Collect This Data</h1>
            <div>
                <p>
                    ohmage is designed for the analysis of scripted self-report
                    (survey) data, smartphone analytics data, and personal data
                    streams such as user activity data. All of these data
                    streams can be combined together to provide useful
                    information to end users, researchers, clinicians and
                    students from a wide variety of application domains. If you
                    are a participant in a study in a domain of research around
                    health behaviors, you will be given a very thorough
                    explanation about the study and the information collected.
                    This process is handled by the
                    <a href="http://ohrpp.research.ucla.edu/pages/about-irb">IRB
                    (Institutional Review Board)</a> from various institutions.
                    Each research study has its own IRB application that is
                    thoroughly vetted and approved by an IRB before the study
                    can begin.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you are a participant in a research study, you always
                    have the option to opt-out and discontinue your
                    participation.
                </p>

            <h1 class="light">Your Privacy</h1>
            <div>
                <p>
                    In cases where you have self-registered with ohmage, it is
                    up to you to choose a username and password. You are also
                    asked to provide your email address. We will only use your
                    email address to contact you to complete the registration
                    process and reset your password should it be necessary.
                    CENS-MobilizeLabs does not share or sell your email address
                    or personal information with any third-party.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In ohmage, you have control over the privacy settings of
                    your self-report data. Each self-report may be marked as
                    "shared" or "private". When a self-report is marked as
                    private, only you, system administrators, and research
                    supervisors can view that data. A research supervisor is a
                    person who is managing a population of participants in order
                    to perform research. As a participant, you may also delete
                    your self-report responses.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For passively collected data such as smartphone analytics
                    and personal data streams, the data is private to you,
                    system administrators and research supervisors. This
                    information is used to analyze self-report data along
                    different axes. For example, your activity may be compared
                    to your self-reports about sleep in a sleep study.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One of our goals is to put you in control of your data. It
                    is also important for system administrators and research
                    supervisors to have access to your data in order to
                    interpret patterns, perform research, and fix system
                    problems. The ohmage team will put your privacy first and we
                    will never share your data with a third-party.
